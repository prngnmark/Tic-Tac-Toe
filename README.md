# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my rendition of The Odin Project's Tic Tac Toe project. I made it really simple for now. Right now, it only supports Person vs Person, but I hope to add an AI opponent mode when I'm done with the whole course. I also plan on cleaning up and optimizing my code. Instead of hardcoding the 3 in a row check, I want to implement the Magic square algorithm. 

Overall, I enjoyed this project. There were times where I had to slow down and think of different ways to solve a problem. If one solution didn't work, I had to keep on thinking of new soluions until one worked.
